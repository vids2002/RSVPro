# My Personal Project: RSVPro

## Guest List Management

The proposed application aims to assist hosts or event managers
in efficiently managing the guest list for a specific event, 
including monitoring RSVP statuses. 

My inspiration for this
project comes from my upbringing in a large family where my 
mother frequently hosted various events. Recognizing the challenges
of organizing and tracking guests for these gatherings, I see the 
potential for this application to be a valuable tool not only for my 
family but also for others facing similar scenarios. The personal
connection to the project motivates me to create a user-friendly 
and effective solution that can streamline the guest management
process for a wide range of events.
